# Bogodroid NEO

A new beginning. New stuff coming soon. Just trying to get to the point where i was before, now with aarch64 compatibility.

Heavily based on JohnnyonFlame's gmloader-next (https://github.com/JohnnyonFlame/gmloader-next) and and ChristopherHX's libjnivm (https://github.com/ChristopherHX/libjnivm).
Uses tomlplusplus (https://github.com/marzer/tomlplusplus) for config. 

Better readme to come as the project develops.
