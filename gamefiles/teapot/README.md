## Example game files: Teapot

These are files extracted from a build of the classic-teapot sample from the Android NDK. It demonstrates 3D rendering through EGL and GLES 2. It also uses the "Native App Glue" library to implement lifecycle events (using ALoooper) and the AAssetManager functions to load shader files, both of which had to be implemented in Bogodroid.
